✨ Key Features
The project was developed with an emphasis on practical usability and clean, modern aesthetics:

Fully Responsive Design: The layout is completely flexible, ensuring the website displays optimally across all devices (mobile phones, tablets, and desktops).

Interactive Menu Display: An engaging section to showcase menu items with pricing and details.

Reservation Form: A simple reservation form with basic client-side validation to ensure data accuracy before submission.

Smooth Scroll Navigation: Utilizes smooth scroll effects to enhance the user's navigational experience between different page sections.

Mobile Navigation: Implementation of a Hamburger Menu for intuitive and accessible navigation on smaller screen sizes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for the foundational structure and semantic content of the website.

CSS3 / SCSS: Employed for advanced styling, modern layouts, and utilizing features like Nested Selectors and Variables for better style organization and maintainability.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Used for implementing interactive functionalities such as the mobile menu toggle and form submission control.

🏗️ Project Structure
The project follows a clean and logical folder structure to ensure maintainability and ease of scaling:

/restaurant
├── index.html          # Main landing page of the website
├── style.scss          # Primary SCSS stylesheet file
├── style.css           # Compiled CSS output file
├── script.js           # JavaScript scripts for interactive elements
├── assets/
│   ├── images/         # Image assets used throughout the website
└── README.md           # Project documentation file

⚙️ How to Run Locally
To get a local copy up and running for development or testing, follow these simple steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/hkermanin/Restaurant-project.git](https://github.com/hkermanin/Restaurant-project.git)

Navigate to the project folder:

cd Restaurant-project/restaurant

Open the file:
Open the index.html file directly in your web browser.

Note: If you plan to make changes to the SCSS files, you must first install and run an SCSS compiler (such as VS Code's Live Sass Compiler or a CLI tool) to convert the changes from style.scss into the usable style.css file.
